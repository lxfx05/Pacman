Play

You can play the game on all canvas-enabled browsers.  **Touch controls** are
enabled for mobile browsers.  The game is **resolution-independent** and smoothly scales to
fit the size of any screen.  **Performance** may increase by shrinking the window or zooming in with your browser.

### Main Controls🎛️

- **swipe**: steer pacman on mobile browsers
- **arrows**: steer pacman
- **end**: pause the game
- **escape**: open in-game menu

### Confirmed Desktop Browers🌐

- Safari
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Via Broswer
- Brave Browser 

### Confirmed Mobile Devices📱

- Iphone 7, 8 , X, Xr, 12 Mini,13, 14, 15 and 16 series

- Samsung from S6 Edge to S25 Ultra Fold and flip models included

- Google pixel

- Huawei phone's 

- Redmi,Xiaomi,Honor,Vivo phone's 

-----

- **Pac-Man**: 1980 original arcade by Namco.
- **Ms. Pac-Man**: 1981 Pac-Man modification by GCC/Midway.

- **Cookie-Man**: a brand new version of Ms. Pac-Man with a sophisticated **procedural map generator**.

### Turbo Mode 🚤

Each game has an alternate mode called Turbo (a.k.a. speedy mode).  This is a
popular hardware modification of the game found in many of the original arcade
cabinets.  In this mode, Pac-Man travels about twice as fast (same speed as the disembodied eyes of the
ghosts) and is not slowed down when eating pellets.

### High Scores 🖱️

High scores for each game (normal and turbo separately) are stored on your local machine by your browser.

Learn Mode 🎓
----------

Learn Mode allows you to visualize the behaviors of the ghosts.  (The colored square represents the ghost bait.)

Practice Mode ⭕
-------------

This mode allows you to practice the game with special features.  You can go
into **slow-motion** or **rewind time** with the special onscreen buttons or the hotkeys listed below.  (The time-manipulation controls and design were borrowed from the game [Braid](http://braid-game.com/)).  You can also turn on **invincibility** or **ghost visualizers** from the menu.

### Practice Controls 🎚️

- **shift**: hold down to rewind (a la Braid)
- **1**: hold down to slow down the game to 0.5x
- **2**: hold down to slow down the game to 0.25x
- **o**: toggle pacman turbo mode
- **p**: toggle pacman attract mode (autoplay)
- **i**: toggle pacman invincibility
- **n**: go to next level
- **q,w,e,r,t**: toggle target graphic for blinky, pinky, inky, clyde, and pacman, respectively.
- **a,s,d,f,g**: toggle path graphic for blinky, pinky, inky, clyde, and pacman, respectively.

Procedurally-Generated Maps
---------------------------

In the **Cookie-Man** game mode, the mazes change as often as they do in Ms. Pac-Man, but are **procedurally generated**.  Each level has a pre-defined color palette, granting an element of consistency to the random structure of the mazes.

### Algorithm Description ❔

The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man.

Accuracy
--------

It is a goal of this project to stay reasonably accurate to the original
arcade game. The current accuracy is due to the work of reverse-engineers Jamey Pittman and Bart Grantham.

Currently, the coordinate space, movement physics, ghost behavior, actor speeds, timers, and update rate match that of the original arcade game.

### Inaccuracies

The **timings** of certain non-critical events such as score display pauses and map-blinking animations are currently approximated.

Unfortunately, you **cannot use patterns from the original Pac-Man** because of complications with random number generators.

Also, the **collision detection** is tighter than the original (checked twice as often) to prevent pass-through "bugs".


### Report/Fix Bugs 👨🏻‍🔧

Feel free to report any inaccuracies that may detract or simply annoy.  Any reverse-engineers willing to contribute their expertise to this project would be a big help as well!

Navigating the Repository
-------------------------
- all javascript source files are located in the "src/" directory
- "build.sh" file concatenates all the source files into "pacman.js" in the top directory
- "debug.htm" displays the game by using the "src/*.js" files
- "index.htm" displays the game by using the "pacman.js" file only
- the "fruit" directory contains notes and diagrams on Ms. Pac-Man fruit paths
- the "mapgen" directory contains notes, diagrams, and experiments on procedural Pac-Man maze generation
- the "sprites" directory contains references sprite sheets and an atlas viewer "atlas.htm" for viewing the scalable game sprites.
- the "font" directory contains font resources used in the game.

### Original Games

Thanks to the original Pac-Man team at Namco for creating such an enduring game.  And thanks to the MAME team for their arcade emulator and very helpful debugger.

Thanks to the Ms. Pac-Man team at GCC for improving Pac-Man with a variety of aesthetic maps that I based the map generator on.
